It will be the biggest commercial rollout of robot rides.</p> <p>The deal announced Wednesday brings together the three elements essential to deploy robo-taxis — a big automaker, an autonomous technology creator and a major ride-hailing company. The plan is to begin significantly expanding the initiative in 2023, with the ultimate goal of dispatching 1,000 self-driving vehicles in the six U.S. cities where Argo has been testing, including Washington.</p> <p>As part of the deal, Lyft is getting a 2.5% stake in Argo, which has received a combined $3.6 billion in backing from Ford and Volkswagen AG. Lyft isn’t making a cash investment, but is allowing Argo access to fleet and safety data that will provide a detailed road map to help establish a large-scale robo-taxi service.</p> <p>The partnership will drive up Argo’s valuation to $12.4 billion, from a previous value of just above $7 billion, according to people familiar with the deal who weren’t authorized to discuss the details and asked not to be identified</p>",

The changes are designed to increase transparency and reduce risk to the market. The new requirements that will go into effect in November include new counterparty protections, requirements for capital and margin, internal risk management, supervision and chief compliance officers, trade acknowledgement and confirmation, and recordkeeping and reporting procedures. Starting next February, for instance, swap data repositories will be expected to disclose data about individual transactions to the public.</p><p> Gensler clarified:“Thus, I’ve asked staff to consider ways we can continue to increase transparency and reduce risk through our unused authorities, particularly with regard to security-based SEFs and position reporting.” </p><p>Toward the end of his speech Gensler said trade reporting rules will apply to cryptocurrencies if the products are security-based swaps:“Make no mistake: It doesn’t matter whether it’s a stock token, a stable value token backed by securities, or any other virtual product that provides synthetic exposure to underlying securities. These platforms — whether in the decentralized or centralized finance space — are implicated by the securities laws and must work within our securities regime.” </p><p>Any offer or sale to retail participants must be registered under the Securities Act of 1933. Gensler said the SEC will use all of the tools they have to make sure investors are protected in these cases </p><p>Regulations for cryptocurrencies have been a major talking point within a number of U.S. government agencies in recent months. The Chairman of the Federal Reserve took a hard line on the need for stricter regulations for stablecoins on July 14, going on to discuss the possibility of a US digital dollar before Congress last week. A bill was also introduced into congress which is meant to provide greater legal definition to digital assets and reduce the fear of future regulations with regard to blockchain-based tokens. On Monday a meeting on regulations for stablecoins by the President's Working Group on Financial Markets shared that they expect to release recommendations for such regulations in the coming months.</p>",

      "content":"<p>While 1999’s The Sixth Sense is rightly regarded as the film that launched M. Night Shyamalan’s career — his latest, Old, opens July 23 — the India-born, Philadelphia-raised director had made two features before it. </p><p>The first, 1992’s Praying With Anger, was an autobiographical film starring Shyamalan and shot while he was a student at NYU. His second outing was a step into the big leagues: On the strength of its script, Wide Awake drew a cast of big-name talent like Rosie O’Donnell, Denis Leary, Dana Delany and Robert Loggia (plus a young Julia Stiles in one of her first roles). </p><p>The film, produced by Harvey and Bob Weinstein for Miramax, was made in 1995. Wide Awake did not follow the supernatural template (plus twist ending) that would become the director’s calling card; this was a sweetly philosophical story of a fifth grader on a mission to find God after his beloved grandfather dies. </p><p>“What a great talent he was,” recalls O’Donnell of Shyamalan; she was 33 when he approached her to play Sister Terry, a Phillies-loving teacher at the boy’s Catholic school. “He was a really loving director and a great guy. He was very family-oriented, talking about how he got married very young. It was a lovely, warm family that this guy seemed to have come from, and I thought, ‘He’s going to be successful.’ He seemed to have his own little universe of support wherever he went.” </p><p>But the positive aura surrounding the shoot ended the moment Shyamalan handed over his final cut to Weinstein and the producer ordered extensive edits. </p><p>“[M. Night] called me up and told me he was having trouble with Harvey — that Harvey had recut his movie and would I talk to Harvey with him,” says O’Donnell. “So we had a conference call where he was in the office with Harvey and I phoned in. And I said to Harvey Weinstein, ‘This kid is an artist. You wouldn’t say to Van Gogh, ‘Less blue.’ Your job as the producer and the distributor is to frame it and sell it, but not to change the canvas.’ And that’s when he called me the C-word. And he said, ‘You don’t know anything. You’re just a talk show host. Who do you think you are?’ And I said, ‘Well, this is the last conversation we’ll ever have.’ And it was.” </p><p>Weinstein’s efforts to bury the film seemed to work: When it was finally released in 1998 — a year after Shyamalan had sold his Sixth Sense spec for a record $2.2 million — the $6 million film grossed just $282,000.</p>",

      "content":"<p>After more than seven years away from the business, a new report says CM Punk could be on his way back to pro wrestling. </p><p>Fightful Select dropped the scoop a short time ago. While they haven’t confirmed with the man himself or AEW officials, the site calls Tony Khan’s company “the most likely landing point” for Punk. </p><p>While other unnamed companies are said to be interested in signing Punk now that wrestling is getting back to normal and there are tickets to be sold, AEW is the only company Punk’s actually talking to about a return. Fightful says they’ve been told the “higher ups in WWE believe that Punk is headed to AEW.” </p><p>Before you get too excited and punch up Living Colour on Spotify, the report cautions there’s no confirmation of a signed contract or any return dates & booking plans, and reminds us that nothing is a 100% done deal until we see something on our screens. </p><p>But this is the first we’ve heard about actual talks for a return for the Chicagoan. AEW makes sense as a landing spot, for at least a couple reasons. One is all the bad blood still simmering from his WWE exit (while Punk worked as a talking head on Fox Sports’ short-lived WWE Backstage studio show, it was made clear he wasn’t working for or with Vince McMahon’s company). Another is that while WWE could give Punk the great big bag of money he’s been saying he’d need to come back, he’s more likely to trust Khan when he promises the other thing he wants - interesting creative, and fresh match-ups. </p><p>Punk’s expressed an interest in continuing with the work he’s been doing outside the wrestling space in recent years, namely MMA commentary and acting. But AEW could almost certainly make room for those things in any deal they work out with him. </p><p>We’ll obviously keep following this closely. In the meantime, let us know what you think in the comments below.</p>",

At some bars in Los Angeles County, proving you're 21 or older won't be enough -- you'll also have to prove that you're vaccinated against COVID-19. </p><p>On Tuesday night, bar-hoppers at Little Joy near Dodger stadium said they approve of bars demanding vaccination proof for entry. </p><p>I'm not going to tell them how to live their life, but if they don\'t want to get vaccinated then they don\'t have to come here,\" said one patron, a Los Angeles resident who identified himself only as Mike S. \"They don't have to come to these bars that require that. It's their business, they can do whatever they want, and if they want to hang out they should get vaccinated.\" </p><p>Little Joy is just one of many bars in L.A. County that now requires vaccine proof. Bars like The Henry, Gold Diggers and Footsies have each published posts on Instagram declaring the new requirement, and many patrons who spoke to ABC7 agree with the policy. </p><p>\"With the Delta variant going around, I think it's probably for the better that -- especially people young like us who are going out are vaccinated to, you know, prevent the spread and hopefully prevent the further adaptations of this virus,\" said Jack Bergon, who was headed to The Short Stop. </p><p>Cities like London have made the move to mandate that all bar patrons must show vaccine proof to enter. For now, individual businesses in L.A. county are making a similar move. </p><p>\"In our demographic, a lot of people in their early-to-mid-20s, late-20s, early-30s, that have gone out, they have taken the risk and they're taking the risk upon themselves,\" said Short Stop patrol Weston Massett. \"And if they choose not to get vaccinated, that's totally their own decision but it's also -- they're putting themselves at risk, they're putting others at risk. </p><p>Some bargoers say that while they respect the decision of those to not vaccinate, that those people should then not try to mix among the vaccinated. </p><p>\"I'm all for it,\" said a customer who identified himself as Jeremy S. \"I think, yeah, as he said earlier, everyone's got their right to do whatever. They don't want to get vaccinated, they probably shouldn't be coming out because they're more likely to spread the disease than people who are.</p>",

    "content":"<p>Multiple recent reports from Apple's supply chain have indicated that a new, greatly upgraded iPhone SE is on the way. </p><p>According to Nikkei, the new iPhone SE is expected to launch in early 2022. The device will feature the same iPhone 8-style design as the existing iPhone—home button included. </p><p>But the new SE will have what will be the most recent iPhone system-on-a-chip, the A15, which is expected to debut with Apple's new flagship phones this fall. </p><p>The new iPhone SE will also feature 5G cellular activity, something Apple first brought to its high-end iPhones late last year. The article specifies that the iPhone SE will use Qualcomm's X60 modem. </p><p>Otherwise, the midrange phone (which also happens to be Apple's cheapest at present) will closely resemble the current iPhone SE, including the 4.7-inch LCD screen. This is in contrast to Apple's flagships, which have OLED screens that offer better picture quality by most measures. </p><p>But new life for the iPhone SE reportedly means death for another of Apple's phone models: the iPhone mini, which was introduced as part of the iPhone 12 lineup just last year. </p><p>We've already seen evidence that the iPhone 12 mini did not sell well, compared to the rest of Apple's lineup. In all likelihood, Apple will sell an iPhone 13 mini later this year, but the Nikkei report says Apple probably won't offer a mini model in the 2022 flagship lineup. That's bad news for lovers of small phones who are still willing to pay for the latest and greatest screen technology and cameras. </p><p>Instead, Apple may include a \"relatively cost-effective version\" of the ultralarge iPhone Pro Max phone in 2022. But Nikkei's sources note that the designs for 2022's phones \"are not yet locked in,\" so Apple's plans could still evolve. </p><p>This Nikkei report follows previous stories from other supply chain sources, as well as predictions from well-known Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, that also claimed a faster iPhone SE with an iPhone 8-like design is on the way.</p>",

    "content":"<p>Amazon has been trying to break into gaming with some in-house efforts over the past couple of years. However, the company hasn’t been too successful. Last year, it released Crucible after six years of development, and shortly after release, it sent the game back into the beta phase before ultimately canceling it altogether. But that’s not as bad as what some players are reporting with the company’s latest game. Multiple users on Reddit and the game’s forums (via Gamespot) have reported that New World is bricking their EVGA-branded GeForce RTX 3090. </p><p>The issue specifically seems to involve the EVGA RTX 3090 FTW3, which isn’t an affordable GPU by any means. The Founders Edition of the RTX 3090 already has an MSRP of $1,499, but this EVGA model actually costs $1,889, according to EVGA’s website. And considering how inflated GPU prices have been for the past year, there’s a good chance some players spent a lot more than that. Reports from users mention that the game suddenly stops working in various scenarios, so it doesn’t seem to be triggered by a specific action. </p><p>Most of the reports seem to be coming from EVGA users, but some have also mentioned the same problem with GPUs from Gigabyte. It seems like New World is causing RTX 3090 GPUs to severely overheat, and the New World team has since responded on the game’s forums. The developer has acknowledged the issue, and for now, it’s recommended that users disable any overrides set in their NVIDIA Control Panel graphics settings. The company also suggests capping the frame rate at 60fps in the game settings to bring GPU usage down. However, it didn’t say anything about a permanent fix. </p><p>In fairness to Amazon Games, this is a beta release of the game, so some issues are expected. However, with New World set to release on August 31, breaking a GeForce RTX 3090 GPU is a severe problem to have at this point in development. Hopefully, the company will issue a fix soon, and GPU owners can get a replacement decently quickly. That might be tricky considering how many reports there have been and the ongoing component shortages, however.</p>",

    "content":"<p>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is teasing that the upcoming v31 update for Oculus Quest “makes it easier to coordinate multiplayer games by sending friends pop-up invites, and gives developers access to Passthrough API Experimental to build and test mixed reality experiences.” </p><p>The update is coming “soon”  with Zuckerberg posting to Facebook that more details are on the way. Recently, Zuckerberg himself has been the first to tease upcoming features for Oculus Quest as the company builds toward a so-called “Oculus Quest Pro” headset to release sometime after 2021. Though Facebook might bump the entry level $299 Quest 2 to 128 GB of storage, Facebook isn’t expected to release a new VR headset in the near future. Instead, the company is focusing on near-constant software updates to the system running Quest 2 to improve the overall experience. Last year, Facebook confirmed it would release an application programming interface (API) that would essentially allow for the development of AR apps on Oculus Quest and gave early access to Spatial, a remote work solution </p><p>A blog post from Facebook details the multiplayer features alongside a new security settings panel that’s coming as well, but the post makes no mention of the passthrough API. Facebook rolls out new software updates for Quest over the course of weeks and even longer for some new or experimental features contained within those updates. An update last month for v30 added multitasking, for example, but we haven’t yet seen the feature on our Quest 2 headsets just yet. </p><p>With multitasking, a larger and smarter guardian system, major new game releases planned like Resident Evil 4, new avatars, and the beginnings of AR apps, Facebook is laying the groundwork for its Quest 2 headset to be a much more compelling platform heading into the holiday gift-buying season in 2021.</p>",

Around 10 million people are currently on the waitlist, a spokesperson confirms, and they’ll slowly be added to the app over time. (Essentially, millions of users won’t be added today, but seemingly, if you attempt to sign up anew, you’ll be able to do so.) Along with the news, Clubhouse showed off a new logo, as well as a new app icon: Justin “Meezy” Williams, rapper 21 Savage’s manager. </p><p>“The invite system has been an important part of our early history,” a blog post about the changes says. “By adding people in waves, welcoming new faces each week in our Wednesday Orientations, and talking with the community each Sunday in Town Hall, we’ve been able to grow Clubhouse in a measured way, and keep things from breaking as we’ve scaled.” </p><p>This change comes only a week after Clubhouse launched its DM product, Backchannel, which the team now says saw 10 million messages sent within the first day of launch, and more than 90 million over the first week. </p><p>Of course, the app opening up comes amid increasing competition. As Clubhouse built out its product and acquired a waitlist, other social audio products, like Twitter Spaces, opened to everyone. If Clubhouse wants to compete, and keep acquiring new users, it’ll have to make sure everyone can actually access it. Part of that journey was bringing the app to Android, in addition to iOS, and now it’s completed the second major step, which is removing any gating around new user signup.</p>",

Because as cool as it sounds, taking a flying motorcycle 15,000 feet in the sky sounds like the start of a modern myth. Especially when it can reach speeds of 300 miles per hour. </p><p>Jetpack Aviation’s “The Speeder” (which we first learned about at DesignTAXI) is a sci-fi dream made a reality. It’s like Star Wars speeders crossed with a Jet Ski and a helicopter. Featuring four turbojet engines, the 231-pound machine can run on kerosene or diesel fuel. It’s also fully stabilized and features a fly-by-wire. And now it’s ready to hit the market. </p><p>According to Luxurylaunches, the company’s jet-powered device completed a successful run of tethered test flights over five months earlier this year. The P1 prototype was able to take-off, climb into the sky, hover in the air, twist and spin, and “perform slow transitions into forward flight.” </p><p>Now that they know it works, the company has already begun work on a more advanced prototype. It will replace the original model’s large aluminum chassis with a smaller frame consisting of carbon-fiber body panels. And Jetpack Aviation already has plans to give the third prototype a fully-formed body along with compact wings. As well as double the amount of engines. Which they say will allow up to 600-pounds to travel 300 miles as high as 15,000 feet for 20 minutes. All in a vertical takeoff and landing vehicle (VTOL) that can fit in the back of a truck. </p><p>The world’s first flying motorcycle will also come in both recreational and military/commercial models. Each with a big initial price tag of $380,000. Which strangely enough is the best reason to feel good about this equally intriguing and terrifying machine. If Daedalus spent that much on Icarus’s wings, he wouldn’t have had to rely on wax.</p>",

    "content":"<p>As Twitter launches Super Follows, YouTube adds new monetization tools and Instagram embraces e-commerce, the social media sphere is heating up with new ways for creators to make a living. Now, Tumblr is joining the fray with Post+, the platform’s first attempt at allowing users to monetize their content. Post+ is debuting today in limited beta for an exclusive selection of creators in the U.S., who were hand-picked by Tumblr. </p><p>Like Twitter’s Super Follows, Tumblr’s Post+ lets creators choose which content they want to put behind a paywall, whether that’s original artwork, personal blog posts or Destiel fanfic. Creators can set the price for their subscriber-only content starting at $3.99 per month, with additional tiers at $5.99 and $9.99. Tumblr will take a 5% cut from creator profits. </p><p>The process of making content under Post+ is the same as any other Tumblr post — all creators will have to do is check a box to indicate that the post is for paying subscribers only, whether that’s a video, audio clip, text post, image, etc. </p><p>“Not reserved only for professionals, or those with 10K followers or higher, Tumblr’s Post+ will push the boundaries of what’s considered money-making content on the internet: Shitposters, memelords, artists, fan fiction writers, all of the above and everyone in between will be able to create content while building their community of supporters, and getting paid with Post+,” a Tumblr spokesperson told TechCrunch. </p><p>For millennials who live-blogged their reading of the last “Hunger Games” book on its release day in 2010, Tumblr might seem like a relic of the past. Founded in 2007, the platform has gone through plenty of change over the years. In 2013, Tumblr was acquired by Yahoo for $1.1 billion, and then Yahoo was later acquired by Verizon. </p><p>But a massive shift came for Tumblr in December 2018, when the platform banned all sexually explicit content and pornography. A month prior, the Tumblr app had been removed from the iOS App Store after child pornography passed through the app’s filtering technology, which led the platform to ban pornography entirely. Four months after the ban, Tumblr’s monthly page views had declined by 151 million, or 29%. Since then, the platform has retained a core userbase, hovering between about 310 million and 377 million page views per month, according to SimilarWeb, though the analytics still indicate a slight downward trend. Tumblr declined to provide its monthly active user numbers, but shared that the platform has more than 11 million posts per day and 500 million blogs. </p><p>In 2019, the platform was sold to Automattic, the company that owns WordPress. Though Tumblr hasn’t exhibited significant growth since the fateful porn ban, under its new ownership, it’s exploring new ways to generate profit by creating features that appeal to its now younger demographic. According to Tumblr, over 48% of users are Gen Z. These Gen Z users spend 26% more time on the platform than older bloggers, and their average daily usage time is increasing over 100% from year to year.</p>",
